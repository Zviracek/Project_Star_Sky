# Project_Star_Sky
Such a fancy name for something as basic as a simple rocket.

The Star_Sky project, as I decided how to call it, is my take on creating a simple model scale rocket.
Something capable of just flying upwards in a stable line and then landing again would be a result, that I would consider adequate. But I am aming higher.

This repository should in the finale contain all the necesarry informations and knowladge, that I gathered trougout the procces of building everything from scratch.
So if you want to follow up, do it. I am open to any improvement to any system I created. All my systems are far from perfect, but for now, they do the job.

The first part of the project is about frame and any parts, that togeather creates the frame assembly.
Second part deals with the flight computer.
And the third is about software.

All the speech about each part would be in their coresponding folders.

Additional informations and files will be added as I progress my work.
